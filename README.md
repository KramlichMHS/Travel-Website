# Travel Website Project

**Directions:** You will create a travel website that will highlight many of the things to do in the chosen city. You may choose your city from the following list: **New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Rome, London, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, Rio De Janeiro, Toronto, Saint Petersburg, Sydney, Dubai, Johannesburg, and Mexico City**. You may choose a city from outside this list but it must be approved by your teacher.

Your website must contain at least 4 pages not including your homepage. These pages can have topics such as **Entertainment, Dining, Places to Stay, Shopping, and Maps/Travel** just to name a few examples. ***Note that these are just examples and you may want to build different pages to fit your city and its activities.***

Your site must also include the use of a **Navigation Bar and/or Buttons**. Other forms of CSS including animations, transitions, or hover/active selectors will be needed to create a Professional Level website.

Before you begin creating your website, you must research your city and create a site map that must be approved by your teacher. You can use google drawings to complete your map. **Your site map must include: each page for the site, the content that will be on each page, and a color scheme to use for your website.** Do your research while you are working on your site map. FYI creating your site map will take a full day.
